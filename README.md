This Project is designed for MOBILE APP ONLY, so please check it in Mobile L dimensions since there was a due date when I was working on it and it is not fully responsive.

Project Goal

To create web space for every street artist that will allow them to be able to track their
income, and to have a place on the web where they can showcase their masterpieces.
What problem does this project solve?
Currently many artists track their expenses in the old traditional way by writing the income
amount in notebooks, and they have no idea how much they earned per performance, or how
much time has been spent creating the art. By creating a platform that will have the ability to
track their income, also will be able to see statistics that will tell them the average price per
piece, the amount that they spent to make that masterpiece, even to be able to display to
them the average price per hour of their work, etc.

Also, many artists nowadays rely all their online presence on their social networks like
Instagram, Facebook to showcase their masterpiece, which in some cases looks
unprofessional. By creating profile pages as part of the platform, artists will be able to
upload their performances and showcase their masterpieces that will allow them to be
discovered easier.
What is the vision?
To help young artists to express themselves through modern technology and to give them
the opportunity to be reachable worldwide.
